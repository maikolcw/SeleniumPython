Getting Started:
We'll need to install the Selenium package. We can use pip to install with following command "pip install -U selenium".
More information can be found here https://pypi.org/project/selenium/
Next we'll need the drivers to interface with the specific browsers we want to run our tests on. The browsers section of
https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/ has more details and you can also get them from https://pypi.org/project/selenium/ 
under drivers section.

Other packages used:
Webdriver manager - manages binary drivers that interface with different browsers for us - pip install webdriver-manager
